### Who am I?

Clinical neonatologist and unabashed geek who enjoys exploring technology and how it can be used to improve patient care.

I'm very interested in clinical data science and applying what I've learned to large patient datasets, for example by developing clinical quality improvement dashboards or generating predictive models for clinical outcomes.

I am also the the developer of [PediTools](https://peditools.org/). The goal of PediTools is to provide medical calculators and links to references useful for practicing pediatric providers.

Occasionally, I post clinical analyses, small coding projects, or ruminations on a blog, [Incidental Findings](https://incidentalfindings.org/).
